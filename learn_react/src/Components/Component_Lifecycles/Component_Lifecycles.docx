I. Mounting
 These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:
  - constructor()
  - static getDerivedStateFromProps()
  - render()
  - componentDidMount()
 Các phương pháp này được coi là kế thừa
 You should avoid them in new code:
   UNSAFE_componentWillMount()
II. Updating
 An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:
 - static getDerivedStateFromProps()
 - shouldComponentUpdate()
 - render()
 - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
 - componentDidUpdate()
 Note: These methods are considered legacy and you should avoid them in new code:
 UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate()
 UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()
III. Unmounting
 This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:
 - componentWillUnmount()
 - Error
IV. Handling
 These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
 - static getDerivedStateFromError()
 - componentDidCatch()
